# ðŸ“„ Project Title
**Event-Driven Neuromorphic Gaze Decoding via e-Skin Electrooculography**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This repository provides the code for a **two-stage neuromorphic gaze decoding pipeline**:

- **LSTM-based sequence learner** â€“ analyzes temporal EOG signals and highlights where attention should be focused.  
- **SNN-based neuromorphic decoder** â€“ receives attention-guided spiking input and performs event-driven gaze decoding.
